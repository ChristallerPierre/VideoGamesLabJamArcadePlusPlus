## Overview
The project is called Escape Gravity (play for free here : https://nitsugua.itch.io/escape-gravity)

The goal is to earn the biggest score. There are 2 ways or earning points :
- surviving : you gain a small amount of points per second alive
- destroying asteroids : 100 pts / each

The game ends whenever you touch the black hole on the left side of the screen. This black hole will suck you in constantly, but your powerful gun will send you flying in the opposite direction whenever you shoot.

## Controls
